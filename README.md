# Mosaic Game

### What is Mosaic

It's an online multiplayer board game heavily inspired by [Azul](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/230802/azul) created by Michael Kiesling. The gameplay rules and stages are the same with a small difference: counting points and mixing used tiles is done automatically.

If you are new to Azul and Mosaic, you can find rules and playthrough on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csJL-78NEPQ)

### How it started

This project started as a quick personal weekend hackathon, but I decided to continue developing it and make it open to people who want to play board games with their friends, but can't because some dude in China ate a Bat...

### Tech stack

The core of the game is:

- [boardgame.io](https://boardgame.io/)
- Typescript
- React
- Node.js

I also use other libraries to play around with them or test their capabilities, but those may change with time.

### Design

I'm not that great of a designer so I asked [Matt Karski](https://www.behance.net/MateuszKarski) for help, and he came up with a great playful design!

### Development

If you are interested in joining the project, [send me a message](mailto:maciek.matuszewski@gmail.com), or simply create an issue on which you would like to work and we can discuss it there!
